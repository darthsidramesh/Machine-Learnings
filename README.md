# Machine Learnings and Teachings

Welcome to my page! Here, I like to document stuff that I've learned in my various projects, whether at Microsoft or at Carnegie Mellon. 

The goal of these projects is to help the Data Science and Machine Learning community out by sharing my experiences and thoughts through code!
