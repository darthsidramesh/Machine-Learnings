This code eventually became the blog post I wrote found at
http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/11/revoscalepy.html.

# Objective

The idea of this project is to show how to build models with categorical
data using Python's popular ML library **sklearn**, and compare it to
the python version of RevoScaleR, **revoscalepy**. 

# Prereqs

- Running the revoscalepy requires an installation of Microsoft ML Server. 
- Running the sklearn code requires Python

# Key Takeaways

More can be found at my blogpost, but the key takeaways are:

1. One-hot encoding is an extra step required by sklearn 
2. Pandas and sklearn do not have the best interaction
3. revoscalepy is amazing if you are coming from an R background (like me)
4. revoscalepy allows for some nice transliteration between R and Python
