# Objective
To educate people on why optimizing your classifiers for utility is crucial to a Machine Learning Project.

To read through the example and understand the concept, click on **utility_movie_example.md**.

# Steps to run R code

To actually run through the code yourself:

1. Use RStudio to open the .Rmd file
2. This requires the RevoScaleR, which must be installed on the machine
3. Install the packages listed in the .Rmd file
4. Click the 'knit' button at the top of the file 
5. Read through the html file 

The **utilityMaximization.R** file has only the R code without the text.
